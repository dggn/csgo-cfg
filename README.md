Paste all files into csgo cfg directory and add +exec autoexec to launch options to use.

Main file is autoexec.cfg which contains all binds game settings and aliases so be sure to read through it fully as it will wipe your current binds when run, most commands are self explanatory if you dont know what one does just google it.

Main crosshairs are stored in Riflecrosshair.cfg, Pistolcrosshair.cfg, Knifecrosshair.cfg and Grenadecrosshair.cfg, simply change out those settings with preffered ones if needed

Aliases:

Dot, changes out default rifle and pistol crosshairs for a simple dot crosshair

vm, change to a more centered viewmodel

sound, changes most game sounds to random half life sound effects (copied from franzj)

nomusic, turns off all ingame music

kzs, used for kz gamemode, unbinds space and increases sensitivity

practice, use in bot server to get unlimited time, ammo, grenades and health, usefull for practicing nades and skill jumps (binds e to toggle noclip)

kz, use in offline server to change game settings to default kz game settings
